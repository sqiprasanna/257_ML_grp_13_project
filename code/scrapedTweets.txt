A small but growing number of older people are taking climate change into account when choosing where to retire. "They ask whether a hurricane or a nor’easter will wipe out the dock," a real estate broker said.
this might sound cynical but i’ve always wondered why no billionaire has singlehandedly funded the halting/reversal of climate change solely for the sake of satisfying their narcissism by being able to say they literally saved the entire human race
Climate Change is the biggest scam of the last 50 years. Who agrees?
Vegans will literally come after Indigenous people’s traditional practices, Small halal butcher shops and everyone in the global south before they actually go after the main individuals responsible for climate change and the farming industry.
Türkiye should be central to environment, climate steps  Türkiye, on the crossroads between three continents, is carrying out prominent projects in its battle against climate change.   President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan speaks during an environment event in Istanbul June 5, 2021.
I’m not worried about climate change because any species that can predict the average temperature a hundred years in advance won’t have trouble handling it.
The science behind global warming/climate change is no better than witchcraft, superstition & black magic. It's a belief cult that hijacks true science. The UN distorts & exploits science in a global power grab & money for the rich. It's the end of free society & all its marvels.
imagine having enough money to like….do something about climate change…but instead you….buy twitter ??
The rising toll of climate change in the U.S. has been measured in lives lost, buildings destroyed and dollars spent on recovery.  A report released on Wednesday found that it's become increasingly common for the federal government to declare disasters. https://nyti.ms/3hBvwWv
Human-made climate change is a hoax. Renewable energy is a scam.

Just in—John Kerry, US special envoy for climate change, has tested positive for #Covid19, complaining of a scratchy throat—development that will sideline him at a crucial moment in the waning hours of negotiations at UN climate talks.
It's wrong to use people suffering from anxiety & other psychiatric disorders into supporting your political agenda. Climate change is real but it's not the end of the world. In fact we're doing a good job dealing with it. Shame on the climate nihilists.

I don't think I've ever seen such anger on Twitter before. This Government sending billions to foreign countries for climate change, legal aid, putting illegal immigrants before it's own people and then taxing the hell out of our own. This isn't going to end well.
While the conversation on climate change is bigger than making individual changes, we all have a responsibility through small acts of re use and recycling avoiding food wastage.  Today is all about re suing and re cycling leftovers turning them into a meal.  #ClimateAction
New  @pewresearch  study reveals climate silence in U.S. religious communities.   If we don’t talk about it, why would we care? And if we don’t care, why would we act? This is why I’m convinced that the #1 most impt thing each of us can do about climate change is TALK ABOUT IT!

Yes. Keep promoting climate change. Reduce your carbon footprint…  This way, the billionaires that you “hate,” can continue to do those things and you can’t. Then,simultaneously laugh at you, for helping them while destroying your own life.

It was through Twitter that youth climate activists successfully advanced the climate conversation from:  "Is climate change real?"  To  "What are we going to do about it?"  That is incredibly important. Without that, bills like the IRA would never have had a climate connotation.

What's so entertaining here is that right wingers didn't promote Elon Musk's rise to prominence. It was climate change fanatics and "I Fucking Love Science!" libtxrds who made him a household name. And now they're crying because 7000 commies got fired

I am genuinely worried about what happens to information circulation without this app. Even the basic thing of government agencies being able to communicate quickly in emergencies. This is going to be especially important as the climate continues to change.

Big Tech is corrupt. Google stopped the red wave in its tracks with fake data & dirty tricks. It protects US Democrats over widespread voter fraud from mail-in ballots. Google/YouTube block any & all criticism of the UN's climate change scam.

I think they were a dress rehearsal for even more authoritarian “climate change” restrictions and mandates. They must’ve been pleased with the compliance.
Hundreds of  @UNFCCC  colleagues & #COP27 volunteers have dedicated their time & energy to help ensure the conference is a success.  I’m profoundly grateful for their impressive contributions.  Now world & business leaders need to match that level of commitment to #ClimateAction.
In 2021, the UK government broke its promise to spend 0.7% of national income on overseas aid, capping aid at 0.5% for at least three years. Those worst-affected by climate change, conflict and food insecurity are being denied money promised to them.

Since nuclear energy could allow us to meet many of the climate activists' goals without causing human suffering, why are so many of them still rejecting it?  At some point you have to wonder whether neo-Malthusian-anti-humanism is the primary motivation, and not climate change.

Well ain’t that something…#ClimateCrisis #savetheplanet #GlobalWarming
It’s weird how Global warming stops every winter. 
'Global warming' has been catastrophic for United Nations' credibility - because it didn't happen. It was all about money, power, influence & trust - the UN failed at everything else. Human society, for all its failings, can't affect the flow of climate cycles & seasonal weather.
Global warming is a relentless propaganda campaign led by marxists in the United Nations & elsewhere. It's an immense gravy train & a scam, a grab for greed & power, hoax on a global scale. It's all fake science. More carbon dioxide will not cause warming - even if it doubled.
Global warming has been faked, based on climate studies for 10K yrs. Massive glacier fields across Europe & America are far more likely. Climate evolves naturally & is not controlled by traces of carbon dioxide. Science doesn't verify the UN's 33yr fear campaign. But money does.
The next time you hear an alarming speech about “global warming” on Earth Day, just remember that the first Earth Day featured alarms about the danger of a new ice age.

Actually, the warming about global cooling Leonard Nimoy was describing in the early 1970s was based on real science that remains relevant today, unlike the  O2-caused Global Warming aka "Climate Change" poppycock.
First global cooling, then global warming.  I must clarify they were forecasts given by "SCIENTISTS" based on data from "studies" of many years. Data that were of no use because the interest of them suddenly changed the way to scare.
Inconvenient reality climate change/global warming is a lie.

The ability of carbon dioxide to warm the atmosphere drops sharply at 20 parts per million. By 100ppm its effect is almost nothing. The job of keeping the air warm & moist is done almost entirely by water vapour (95%). This is ignored in the UN global warming/climate change hoax.
Message for climate protesters: artists are not responsible for global warming. If you want to draw attention to this issue go spray paint the corporate hq’s and factories that are the leading contributors to this crisis. That would help educate the public. This is mere vandalism

SCIENTISTS WHO SAY 1.5C IS POSSIBLE DON'T BELIEVE IT IS A Nature anonymous survey (Nov. 2021) found few IPCC scientists thought limit warming 1.5°C.

So, if Earth can regulate its own temperature, does it mean it can also cancel out #GlobalWarming on its own?    Probably not. These geological processes occur over tens of thousands of years, which is too slow to save our planet from anthropogenic #ClimateChange!
